    <h3>Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub</h3>

        The most important concepts we learned this week were version control and how Git and GitHub works, all super handy tools. Version control keeps track of your files and all the changes you've made and when you made them. So if you screw up, you can just go back to an earlier version of the file before things started going downhill. These different saved versions of your file are called a commit; you can think of them as a snapshot in time of your code. A good analogy, would be a checkpoint in a video game, if you die or fail in the middle of a video game, you can just go back to your last save point or in our case the last commit and proceed from there.

        Version control becomes much more powerful and useful when you work on the same files with other collaborators. Instead of sending files back and forth to one another, teams can do something called a merge that combines commits by different users into one complete file. This way, team memmbers can work on different parts of the code without stepping on each others' toes and overwriting each others' code.
      </br>

        This brings us to the topic of Git which is one of the most popular version control systems available. Git is a free, local software that tracks the files and folders of a project's lifecycle. It lets you create branch structures where you work on your code without affecting the "master" version. Once you are happy with your code, you can then merge the new branch back to the master. This branch structure allows multiple users to easily work on the same project and merge their changes into the master. Git will also track all the commits that you made throughout your coding process so you have different snapshots in time of your code to fall back on should any issues come up.

        We can't talk about Git without also mentioning GitHub. These two terms are easily confused with one another but they are actually two different things. GitHub is a popular website that allows us to store our local Git projects in a remote location online so that other users can collaborate and help manage the same files. The benefit of storing your files on GitHub is that it acts as the central repository to keep your whole team on the same page. When you commit your changes to GitHub, other develoeprs can pull the changes to their local repositories and vice versa; making it an invaluable tool.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used the article and section tags in this challenge as they are useful for organizing blog post information including headers and images. I'm sure I will continue to utilize these tags for future blog posts.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elemenents are laid out on a page based on their semantic mark up tags. HTML5 introduces new semantic elements that give the user a good idea how the elements will be laid out by their names. The browser reads the opening and closing tags of an element to determine how and where that element should be displayed.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learend some pretty cool tidbits about Sublime in this challenge. The snippet tool will definitely come in handy and save some valuable time in getting basic templates set up especailly for creating multiple webpages. The html shortcut was also quite handy and I'll definitely want to look into more shortcuts when I get a chance to improve my efficiency with the application.
