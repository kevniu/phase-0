<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It felt good to be able to put into use the things we learned from codecademy and other resources and see how they work in an actual application.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching and using semantic elements for HTML5 was pretty cool, as they added a lot of new elements with logical names amd corresponding placement to better organize your content.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I tried to just organize my information in a basic structure without worrying too much about styling text as I know itâ€™ll be a huge time saver later on when we use CSS to format.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Formatting the image was probably the most difficult part for us as there isn't an easy way to do it and preview what we were doing. Once we get into CSS, I'm sure it'll make styling our page much less labor intensive.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I think one of the main things to remember about HTML is just to make sure you close your tags in the proper place. If you think about your tags in an information heirarchy, it helps to to figure out where the starting and ending tags should go.
