What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The 6 phases include information gathering, planning, design, development, testing/delivery, and maintenance.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The site's primary goal would be to provide information about me, most likely to potential employers. As of now the content will be pretty basic, with information regarding some info about me and links to my social networks and my blog. I would later like to add on projects that we will building at DBC to show as a portfolio to potential employers along with a list of skills as we learn more technologies/languages.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience would probably be someone from the tech scene, so I would want it to appeal to a web designer. which mean I would want the site to be easily navigatable with a clean layout design with multiple ways of contact through my social networking channels to show

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action the user should take is to see information regarding my portfolio and skills. The ultimate goal would be to have potential employers contact me after seeing some of my projects in my portfolio or browsing through my profile.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
The main thing someone should know about design and user experience is that it deals with the user's needs, it studys the reactions while interfacing with the product and whether or not the user has a good time with using it. User experience design delves into how a person feels when interacing with a system. These feelings can include how users feel in regards to a number of things including usability, navigation, and accessibility. It's valuable becaue if the user doesn't have a pleasant experience interacting with the system, then it's less likely they would want to interface with that site again. Which means potential losses of revenue for the company that built that system.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The most tedious part would be trying to figure out if I have the correct syntax to properly display my image in my reflection file.
