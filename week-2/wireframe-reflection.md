What is a wireframe?
A wire frame is an image or set of images that show the fundamental elements of a webpage. It's used for planning a site's organizational structure and interaction.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
The benefits of wireframing include being able to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by the the little details such as typeface or color selection. It allows you to define your hierachy of information and how you want the user to interact with it.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I do enjoy wireframing my site as it's great way to start to conceptualize the look and feel of your site and how the information is going to be laid out.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with my first gebneral idea for now, but I'm sure as I work more on it, I'll want to make changes to better organize information or make it more visually appealing. My design will likely get more refined as well as I go through more iterations.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I guess the biggest question I had was how should I get started? So I went on google images to get some inspiration for blog/personal page designs and the look that I wanted for my page and sort of take those ideas and incorporate the information I needed to convey.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed laying out the information in a way that I thought was visually appealing while also trying to make sense of how I would want to navigate the website if I was the user. Parts I found tedious were having to redraw when I decided I wanted certain information in a different spot than what I had came up with initially.
