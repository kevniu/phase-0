Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To clone a repo to your computer, go to the repo that you want to clone on your Githug page and click on it. There should be a link labeled HTTPS for you to copy to your clipboard. Then open up your terminal and navigate via cd and ls commands into the directory that you would like to clone to. Then type git clone followed by the URL you copied.

Describe what open source means.
Open source means sharing how a program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source can be an awesome resource to foster collaboration and innovation, but it seems like some people can be taken advantage of while others profit.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow the owner to still hold the original copyright on their work. It adds a layer of protection before giving out specific permission for others to use that work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
After completing the challenge, I have a much better understanding of the concepts of branches and merging. My aha moment came when I understood that git merge master means merging the master into the feature, the way the command is phrased makes it seem like the other way around.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I went through the intro tutorials on Code School and Codecademy for Git which helped to reinforce the topics introduced here.
