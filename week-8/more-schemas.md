I thought of this example because a person can only have one drivers license at least in the state of California.

### Release 6: Reflect

1. What is a one-to-one database?

A one-to-one database is where the primary keys of each table corresponds to exactly one foreign key of another table.


2. When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

A one-to-one database is used when two things have a single relationship to one another.


3. What is a many-to-many database?

A many-to-many database has tables where one table has a primary key that corresponds to many foreign keys of another table, and that other table also has a primary key that corresponds to many foreign keys of
the first table.


4. When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

Many-to-many databases are used when two databases have a relationship where it has and belongs to many others.

5. What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

I understand the general idea of a "many-to-many" relationship, but I find it difficult to model. This challenge wasn't too bad since it the directions were explicitly laid out, but I think it would be difficult to come up with an example on my own. It also took me awhile to come up with a one-to-one relationship example.
